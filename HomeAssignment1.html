                <h2> Disadvantages </h2>
                <p> 
                    For most people, passion fruit is perfectly safe to eat. </br>
                    However, some people with a latex allergy may react to passion fruit. </br>
                    This is called cross-reactivity. This is because there are some proteins in latex that are similar to those in passion fruit. </br>
                    People with a latex allergy should be careful when eating passion fruit until they know whether they also react to the fruit.
